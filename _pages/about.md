I am an assistant professor at the [Institute of Mathematics Science](https://ims.shanghaitech.edu.cn/ims_en/) of [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). My research areas include arithmetic geometry, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In particular, I am interested in the connection between (l-adic) Galois representations and their application in arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. In addition, I am also working on some projects in algebraic geometry over finite fields and the computational aspects of all the above. 

During 2019-2022, I was a postdoc at [Colorado State University](https://mathematics.colostate.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Jeff Achter](https://www.math.colostate.edu/~achter/) and Professor [Rachel Pries](https://www.math.colostate.edu/~pries/). 
In 2019, I completed my Ph.D at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.math.umass.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Siman Wong](https://www.math.umass.edu/directory/faculty/siman-wong).
